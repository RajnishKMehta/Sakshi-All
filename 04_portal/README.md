**Sākṣī Portal** ("Sākṣī (साक्षी)" = "Witness" in Sanskrit) is the user-facing application for the open-source Sākṣī Android ecosystem. It provides the interface for browsing, viewing, and managing media safely stored in the independent **[Sākṣī Vault](https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Sakshi-Vault)**.

---

## Features

- **Media Browsing:** Browse photos and videos securely stored within Sākṣī Vault.
- **Media Playback & Viewing:** Built-in viewer for photos and smooth playback of normal MP4 and crash-safe fMP4 video containers using AndroidX Media3.
- **Export & Management:** Securely export or manage your files. Relies on modern `MediaStore` APIs.
- **Modern UI:** Built fully with Jetpack Compose and Navigation 3 for a responsive and intuitive user experience.
- **Offline Capable:** Does not require an internet connection, keeping your media completely local and secure.

## Ecosystem Architecture

Sākṣī Portal connects with Sākṣī Vault to fetch and display the user's stored media.

1. **[Sākṣī Camera](https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Sakshi-Camera)** — captures media.
2. **[Sākṣī SDK](https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Sakshi-SDK)** — provides the API and IPC layer.
3. **[Sākṣī Vault](https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Sakshi-Vault)** — safely stores media independently.
4. **Sākṣī Portal** (this repo) — browses and manages the stored media.

---

## Integration

Sākṣī Portal utilizes the [Sākṣī SDK](https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Sakshi-SDK) for inter-process communication with [Sākṣī Vault](https://github.com/RajnishKMehta/Sakshi-Vault).

If you are a developer looking to integrate or extend functionality, refer to the SDK documentation.
